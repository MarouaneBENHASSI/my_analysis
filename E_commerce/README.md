------------
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.
I also used the following Python libraries: 
Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data. 
Matplotlib Library: I visualized the data. 
Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis. 
Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my Python scripts. 
Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
